I am an assistant professor at School of Public, Nonprofit & Health Administration at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/spnha/) where I research and teach research methods, public administration and nonprofit management. I earned my PhD from [Rutgers University](http://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu), my MPA from [American University](https://www.american.edu/spa/), and my BA from [Zhejiang University](http://www.cec.zju.edu.cn/). 

My research focuses on the effects of public and nonprofit information on citizens' decisions of coproducing public goods and services. My dissertation [*Information and Donations*](https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/T35T3PDQ) was awarded the Public Management Research Association [Best Dissertation Award](https://pmranet.org/awards/) in 2018. My experimental study of [representative bureaucracy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.12401) was one of the 2018 *Public Administration Review*'s highly cited articles.
