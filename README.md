I am an associate professor of public and nonprofit management in the School of Public and International Affairs ([SPIA](https://www.spia.pitt.edu/)) at University of Pittsburgh where I research and teach public administration and nonprofit management. Prior to GSPIA@Pitt, I was an assistant professor at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/spnha/). I earned my PhD from [Rutgers University](http://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu), MPA from [American University](https://www.american.edu/spa/), and BA in Economics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.cec.zju.edu.cn/). 

I am interested in research methods, public administration and nonprofit management, and comparative public administration with a focus on China. Currently, I am using mixed methods, such as machine learning and experiments, to study how public and nonprofit information influences coproduction and donation. My works appeared in *Public Administration Review*, *Public Management Review*, *American Review of Public Administration*, *Nonprofit & Voluntary Sector Quarterly*, among others. 

My dissertation [*Information and Donations*](https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/T35T3PDQ) was awarded the Public Management Research Association [Best Dissertation Award](https://pmranet.org/awards/) in 2017. I was awarded the best paper award from the ASPA Section on Nonprofit (2024), Felice Davidson Perlmutter Award for Best TIBS Conference Paper from the Association for Research on Nonprofit Organizations & Voluntary Action (2022), the GVSU Russell G. Mawby Faculty Fellow in Philanthropic Studies (2021), the GVSU Outstanding Contribution in a Discipline Award (2021), the GVSU Distinguished Early Career Scholar Award (2020), the ASPA Founders' Fellow (2020), and the ARNOVA Emerging Scholar Award (2016).
